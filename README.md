Open Tools for LiDAR is part of the MALiAp scientific research project, which aims at the strives towards methodological maturity of airborne LiDAR in archaeology. Our intention is to provide open access tools for QGIS to assist archaeologists in processing point cloud LiDAR data. Each of the tools we are developing is based on over a decade of experience. The scientific background for the tool is/will be published in open access peer reviewed papers.
